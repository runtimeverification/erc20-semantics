test.preamble();

// Testing transfer(To,Value) when To = caller and possibly overflow.
// There is no overflow with our ERC20 spec, however, because we assumed that
// implementations are more likely to first deduct the Value from the caller
// and then add it to the receiver.  Implementations that first add and then
// deduct will therefore be incorrect with this version of the ERC20 spec.
// This test also shows that we cannot let transfer to self naively follow from
// the general/default definition of transfer, because the latter checks
// `BalanceTo +Int Value <=Int MAXVALUE` and throws if false.
// Recall that 2^256 (a 78 digit numer) is:
// 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936
